# Pique Woo Child Theme
A WordPress WooCommerce compatible child theme for [Pique](https://github.com/sarahmonster/pique).

This child theme grew out of a [conversation on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/woocommerce-support-for-pique-theme).

## Installation
Download the .zip file and upload it via the Appearances/Themes tab in your WordPress admin interface by clicking on "Add New". Once uploaded, activate the theme from the theme dashboard. [For this theme to work properly, one must also have the parent [Pique theme](https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/pique/) installed in a folder in themes named `pique-wpcom`.]

WordPress.org will eventually release a version of the parent theme, which will live in a folder named `pique`. If you are using this case, be sure to change the Template name in style.css to match properly, or the child theme won't register a parent theme.
